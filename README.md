For my final project for Peter Stone's Autonomous Robots class, I'm going to be investigating the use of discriminative models for modelling the ball in robot soccer (position and speed).

Because I'm as interested in the models as I am in the end application, I'm going to be implementing all of the discriminative models. Here are the ones I have planned:

- Linear Regression
- Softmax
- Fully-Connected Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network

For each classifier, in order to gain intution, I'll implement a 1d version of it (no vectors nor matrics) and then extend it to handle arbitrarily-sized input. I was heavily inspired to take this approach by [Andrev Karpathy's Backpropagation tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/). Thanks Andrev!
